⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The minimum supported version of Starlight is now `0.30.0`.

Please follow the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs/starlight%400.30.0) to update your project.

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The generated RSS feed no longer includes content of blog posts due to a [regression](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/12669) in Astro v5. The feature will be restored in a future release. If you rely on this feature, please stay on a previous version of Starlight and Astro in the meantime.
